This code along the pdf contain my participation and contribution to a project beetween the university of lyon 2 and the Cancerology research center in Lyon (CRCL). The goal was to analyse single cell data from patients with skin cancer and find the best method to visualise this complex and multi-dimensional data. 

One of the methods that I found more claryfing and brought many results was the implementation of an scVI model in the single cell data [explain how it works briefly]. Along with some graphs methods like t-sne, that further explained our data. 

This showed to be a very challenging project mainly because the structure of the data, with a problem that is somewhat common in medicinal data where we have more p than n. 

This internship has allowed me to explore this type of single cell data, which is very peculiar and has its specificities, as any dataset has. I needed to do a heavy reasearch academic, to be able to further comprehend the data, and so to better process it without losing its meaning. 

The results where quite satisfying as in the final clustering we are able to see somewhat a group structure within these patients. And this structure profed to remain constant during my many iterations of methods like t-sne, which are know to not minimizing always in the same spot, due to its stochastic nature, and minimization configuration. 

Methodology and results are further explained in my pdf (french)
